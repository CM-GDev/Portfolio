# <Portfolio WebSite>

## Description

- This is my second homework assignment for Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.
- The homework assignment was to create a Portfolio webpage from scratch. The purpose for the webpage is to showcase current and future projects to potential employers.
- In completing this assignment I was able to apply the lessons from week two: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

The following is a screen shot of my Portfolio page when it was first submitted for review:
